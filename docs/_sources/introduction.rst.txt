**Introduction**
================

----

Version |release| for version |version| of the CF conventions.

The Python cf package is an Earth science data analysis library that
is built on a complete implementation of the CF data model.


**Implementation**
------------------

----

The cf package implements the CF data model for its internal data
structures and so is able to process any CF-compliant dataset. It is
not strict about CF-compliance, however, so that partially conformant
datasets may be ingested from existing datasets and written to new
datasets.This is so that datasets which are partially conformant may
nonetheless be modified in memory.

The cf package can:

* read field constructs from netCDF and UM datasets,

* create new field constructs in memory,

* inspect field constructs,

* test whether two field constructs are the same,

* modify field construct metadata and data,

* create subspaces of field constructs,

* write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,

* incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files,

* read, write, and create data that have been compressed by
  convention (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays), whilst presenting a
  view of the data in its uncompressed form,

* Combine field constructs arithmetically,

* Manipulate field construct data by arithmetical and trigonometrical
  operations,

* Perform statistical collapses on field constructs,

* Regrid field constructs,

* Apply convolution filters to field constructs,

* Calculate derivatives of field constructs,

* Create field constructs to create derived quantities (such as vorticity).

**Visualization**
-----------------

Powerful, flexible, and very simple to produce visualizations of field
constructs uses the `cfplot <http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot>`_
package, that is automatically installed with cf.
